# Assumptions Made:
1) Although it wasn't mentioned as a requirement, I thought adding a sorting feature for price/model year would be helpful for users to find the car they want
2) When user clicks on Filter button at the top of the page, I assumed that the user wants to try new search criteria. Therefore I reset all criteria to default values.

# How to bring app up locally:
1) Fork and clone repo to your machine.
2) Install dependencies (npm or yarn install)
3) npm start
4) Click on the localhost:19002 link that pops up in your terminal above the QR code. Once on this page, change Connection type to be Tunnel (this is what works for me, may have to try one of the other three options on your end)
5) Scan the QR code using the camera on your phone (if iPhone) or using the Expo Go app (if Android)
6) The file should bundle and open on your phone.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any troubles opening the application on your phone.

Time taken to complete: 12-15 hours

Level of difficulty: 5/10

This assessment was a lot of fun! Definitely prefer this style over a Leetcode style assessment as it allows for more creativity with solutions and tests applicable skills that will be used in the actual role. The requirements were clear and easy to understand.
